Hangman


I used runpython.com and imported random and string. I used Python 3. It has three main if statements that run the three options for the game. The data stored by the computer is the input of the word to be guessed or the letter guesses of the word. The letter guesses are stored in lists and the words are stored as variables. The guesses and number of turns left are displayed to the user.
