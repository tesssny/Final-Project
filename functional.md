Hangman


 My program is a version of hangman with no graphics. It has three settings: the user guesses a word from the computer, the user inputs a word and the computer guesses, and two users play a regular game of hangman. The user accesses the program via runpython.com. The program responds to user input solely through typing into pop-up boxes from the program.
